In addition you also need to analyze data using the following Little Lemon data file (In Tableau) ✅ <- data [here](https://github.com/corinabioinformatic/db-capstone-project/blob/main/EqSK5enRQCuwiucbZmZelA_27d5699c265a45b38d7a8155ed768be1_LittleLemon_data.xlsx)


Once you have created the appropriate models, database schema, and completed the data analysis in Tableau, you then need to commit the project to your GitHub and upload the link.
