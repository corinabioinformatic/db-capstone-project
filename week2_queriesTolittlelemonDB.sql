/* Task 3
 Little Lemon need you to find all menu items for which more than 2 orders have been placed.
 You can carry out this task by creating a subquery that lists the menu names from the menus table for any order quantity with more than 2.
Hereâ€™s some guidance around completing this task: 
    Use the ANY operator in a subquery
    The outer query should be used to select the menu name from the menus table.
    The inner query should check if any item quantity in the order table is more than 2.
